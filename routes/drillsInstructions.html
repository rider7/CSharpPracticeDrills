  <p> In this section, we'll be focusing on branching and using if/else statements.

In order to properly design an application, a developer must expect different values from a user or third party service. In this case, we have to use conditional statements using if/else code blocks.

We are start by defining a boolean names raining. The boolean variable can have a set value of false.

Next, we need to make sure that if(raining) is true, we can continue to the next line. In this case, Visual Studio has set the next lines of code to be a lighter color which means the code is unreachable.

Unreachable? We'll, Visual Studio is smart to know that because the valeu of raining is set to false, the code will not execute and run the Console.WriteLine line we have defined. </p>
