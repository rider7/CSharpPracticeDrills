            <li> This app is uses the same calculator logic we discussed on Wednesday from the curriculum.
                <br> Check the gitbook week 1 for a review of the logic. </li>
            <li> This app will be used to find the sum of two numbers and must meet the following parameters: </li>
            <ul id="instructions-list">
                <li> Console should write the text "Addition Time!"</li>
                <li> Console should write the text "Press Enter To Begin" </li>
                <li> User should then have to press enter to proceed </li>
                <li> Console should write the text "What is your first number?" </li>
                <li> User should then be able to enter the first number. </li>
                <li> Console should write the text "What is your second number?" </li>
                <li> User should then be able to enter the second number. </li>
                <li> Console should write the "Here is your answer!" </li>
                <li> Console should write the sum of the two numbers showing the full expression in the format below. Example: 3 + 5 = 8 </li>
            </ul>
            <li> For more practice create this app for subtraction, multiplication, and division! </li>
        </ul>
